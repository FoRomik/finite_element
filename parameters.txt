%%%%%%%% PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%

force = one
mesh = square

%%%%% AVAILABLE OPTIONS %%%%%%

Change the rhs of the above equalities to change the parameters.
The available parameters are:

- force: the function of the right hand side of the heat equation
- mesh: the triangulation of the domain on which the equation will be solved

Currently, the available options for each parameter are:

- force:
    - sinsin: (2*pi^2)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)
    - one: 1 (the constant function 1)

- mesh:
    - square: a square of side 1, ms=0.1 (286 elements)
    - HQsquare: a square of side 1, ms=0.02 (6874 elements)
    - l_sh: an L-shape (three squares, each of side 1, for the L-shape)
    - half_circle: a half circle
