* FINITE ELEMENTS
** Introduction
   The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to boundary value problems for partial differential equations. In other words it can be used to find solutions to problems that can be expressed into 'governing equations' and 'boundary conditions'.

   One of the relatively easy problems to sole with FEM is the *Poisson's problem, modeling the diffusion of temperature in a body*. Which can be stated as follows. Given a domain \Omega \subset R^{2}

   -\Delta /u = f/   in \Omega \\
   /u = 0/    in \delta \Omega

   It can be proved that a solution, which is characterized by two continuous derivatives (in other words /u = C^{2}/) exists and its unique
